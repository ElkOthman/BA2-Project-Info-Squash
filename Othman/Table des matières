main: Code basique, balle bouge et rebondit sur des parois

01 : Added features: Text information above view showing: Lives left, y coordinate of center of the ball, Score (=number of time top <Paroi> is hit)
                     Icons/Images depending on lives left above view
                     When a ball leaves screen (in bottom only for now): lives reduced by 1, ball disappears, a new ball appears (until no lives left)
                     When clicking on button: bottom <Paroi> is hidden/showed
                     
02 : Added features: SuperClass SpecialObject which will herit Bonus/Malus class
                     Bonus class : SizeUp : multiplies the current ball diameters by a size amplificator if < maxSize
                     X coordinate (information text)
                     deleted supportActionBar
                     added scoring argument in Paroi class
                     
03 : Added features: Deleted SizeUp bonus class --> transformed it into SizeModifier class. 
                          If boolean argument is true SizeModifier is considered as a bonus class (increases ball size)
                          If boolean argument is false SizeModifier is considered as a malus class (decreases ball size)
                          
04 : Added features: SpecialObject class can now have 2 timers: 1 to know how much time is available to pick up the bonus
                                                                1 to know how much time a bonus will be running for
                     Modified SizeModifier class
                     Created LifeUp Bonus Class. Gives one more live when activated
                     Created DoublePoints Bonus class. For now it only gives 2 points instead of 1 while the bonus is active
                     Created OneWayWall Malus class that uses the newly created Obstacle class: it makes the ball rebound against the wall if ball comes from the bottom
                     Note: Obstacle Class could not herit from SpecialObject AND Paroi so it only herits from Paroi but it feels kinda empty 
                           (create Obstacle class in OneWayWall CLass ???)
                     Implemented acceleration every time the score is a multiple of 3
                     Modified a bit Paroi and Balle class for it to work with bonus/malus and acceleration
